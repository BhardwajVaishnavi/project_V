## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Problem
All `/api/*` routes were returning `404 Route not found` on Vercel deployment.

### Root Cause
The `vercel.json` routing configuration had a single catch-all route that wasn't preserving request paths correctly for Express routing.

### Solution
Updated `vercel.json` to explicitly define routes for each endpoint pattern:
- `/api/(.*)` → `api/index.js`
- `/health` → `api/index.js`
- `/ping` → `api/index.js`
- `/` → `api/index.js`

### Result
✅ All routes now working perfectly on Vercel
