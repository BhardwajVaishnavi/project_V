# üîß App Crash Fix - Complete Summary

## ‚úÖ Problem Identified & Fixed

**Issue:** App was crashing on startup with error: "closed because this app has a bug - try updating this app after its developer provides a fix for this error"

**Root Cause:** The light color scheme configuration was causing rendering issues with Material 3's color scheme generation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Applied

### 1. **Fixed Theme Configuration** (`lib/main.dart`)
**Problem:** Using a very light color (#F5F5F5) as the seed color for Material 3 was causing issues.

**Solution:** Changed to use green (#2E7D32) as the seed color while keeping the light background:
```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  primaryColor: const Color(0xFF2E7D32), // Green
  useMaterial3: true,
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xFF2E7D32), // Green-based theme
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
  scaffoldBackgroundColor: const Color(0xFFF5F5F5), // Light background
),
```

### 2. **Added Error Handling to All Logo Images**
Added `errorBuilder` to all `Image.asset()` calls to prevent crashes if the logo fails to load.

**Files Updated:**
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Splash screen logo (120x120)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/dashboard_screen.dart` - Dashboard header logo (40x40)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/vital_signs_screen.dart` - Vital Signs header logo (40x40)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/lab_values_screen.dart` - Lab Values header logo (40x40)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/medications_screen.dart` - Medications header logo (40x40)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/appointments_screen.dart` - Appointments header logo (40x40)
- ‚úÖ `lib/screens/home/profile_screen.dart` - Profile header logo (40x40)

**Error Handler Pattern:**
```dart
Image.asset(
  'assets/logo/KIMS.png',
  width: 40,
  height: 40,
  errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {
    return Container(
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: const Color(0xFF2E7D32),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      ),
      child: const Icon(
        Icons.local_hospital,
        size: 24,
        color: Colors.white,
      ),
    );
  },
)
```
